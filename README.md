# R_Cookbook
I'm currently enrolled in the Data Analysis with R class at the UCSC Extension Campus. Our assigned textbook is: "R Cookbook: Proven Recipes for Data Analysis, Statistics, and Graphics (O'reilly Cookbooks) 1st Edition" by Paul Teetor (Author). You can find this book at the following Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-Analysis-Statistics-Graphics-Cookbooks/dp/0596809158
This repository will contain the code that I complete from the book's exercises.
